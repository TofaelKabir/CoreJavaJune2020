/*
Array vs ArrayList:

Array is static in size that is fixed length data structure, one can’t change the length after creating the Array object. 

ArrayList is dynamic in size. Each ArrayList object has instance variable capacity which indicates the size of the ArrayList. As elements are added to an ArrayList its capacity grows automatically.


ArrayList can’t contains primitive data types (like int, float, double) it can only contains Object while Array can contain both primitive data types as well as objects. 

We can use iterator to iterate through ArrayList. The iterators returned by the ArrayList class's iterator and list iterator method are fail-fast. 

We can use for loop or for each loop to iterate through array. 

Length of the ArrayList is provided by the size() method while Each array object has the length variable which returns the length of the array. 

Array can be multi-dimensional, while ArrayList is always single dimensional. 

Arrays are object, ArrayList is a class. [can't explain]
