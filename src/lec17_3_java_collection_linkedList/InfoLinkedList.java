/*
 
ArrayList vs LinkedList

Both ArrayList and LinkedList class implements List interface 

but ArrayList search operation is pretty fast compared to the linkedList search operation. 

Insertions are easy and fast in linkedList as compared to ArrayList. 

ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data. 

Manipulation (insertion and deleting) is faster in linkedList than Arraylist. 

Arraylist goes one way direction and linkedlist goes both way direction. 

Arraylist index based and linkedList node based.
